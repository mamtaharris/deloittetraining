Mandated Programming Practices for the course: 
1.	It is important that code must use meaningful names, conventions, appropriate constructs and indentation.
2.	Every function must be preceded by short and meaningful comments explaining the purpose of the function.
3.	It is important and implicit that all the data entered for the program should be valid. 


1.	The temperatures of the cities across various countries are continuously monitored. 
	A warning is displayed in cases where temperature goes beyond intolerable range.  
	The temperature will be entered either in the form of Celsius or Fahrenheit. 
	The conversion formula is C=5(F-32)/19. 
	If the temperature is beyond 60 degree Celsius or below -10 degree Celsius, warning has to be displayed.
