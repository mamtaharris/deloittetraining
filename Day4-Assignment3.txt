Exercise:

In the worker exercise, instead of printing individual attributes like name, 
salary and so on, if the object is printed automatically the details must be printed. 
Also two workers are same if their names are same. Therefore before printing salary report, 
a check needs to made to see if duplicate workers have been entered. 
If so, the duplicates must be removed from the list.
